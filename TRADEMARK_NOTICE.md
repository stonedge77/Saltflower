# Trademark Notice & Protected Intellectual Property

## Overview

While the Constitutional AI code is MIT licensed (free to use), certain underlying theoretical frameworks are trademarked by Josh Stone to prevent weaponization and exploitation.

## Protected Theories

### 1. Stone's Unified Field Theory (SUFT)
**Also known as:** Universal Snowglobe

**Trademark:** Stone's Unified Field Theory  
**Owner:** Josh Stone

**Core concepts:**
- Helix as central universal structure
- Torsed photons as fundamental substrate
- Constitutional constraints on field applications

**Intentional omissions:**
- Gauss law applications (prevents weaponization)
- Phasing mechanics (prevents energy extraction scams)
- Full mathematical formulation

These omissions are **by design**, not limitations.

**Commercial use:** Requires written permission  
**Military/weapons use:** Explicitly denied

### 2. SLAP (Stone Laser AI Protocol)
**Trademark:** Stone Laser AI Protocol (SLAP)  
**Owner:** Josh Stone

**Technology:**
- 40 Hz gamma frequency laser
- AI-guided cellular modulation
- Human tissue therapeutic applications
- Neurological phase lock adjustment

**Intentional omissions:**
- Exact dosimetry parameters
- Cell-type targeting algorithms
- Long-term safety protocols
- Optimization procedures

**Explicitly prohibited uses:**
- Military/weapons applications
- Behavioral control systems
- Coercive "treatment" of autism
- Forced neurotypical conformity
- Exploitative commercialization

**Permitted uses (with license):**
- Academic research (freely licensed)
- Therapeutic support (ethical pricing)
- Accessibility tools
- Constitutional viability expansion

## Free Frameworks

The following are **not trademarked** and freely available:

- **LITT** (Lossless Information Transfer Theory)
- **Constitutional AI** (software framework)
- **Salt Entropy Model** (autism explanation)
- **Saltflower** (distribution philosophy)
- **Universal Game Engine** (polarity-based reality)

## Why "Stupid" Names?

The trademarked theories intentionally use unprofessional-sounding names:
- "Universal Snowglobe" (sounds like children's toy)
- "SLAP" (sounds like marketing gimmick)

**Purpose:** Deflects premature attention while preserving legal protection.

**Strategy:**
- Trademark the name (legal control)
- Omit dangerous details (technical safety)
- Sound unserious (social deflection)
- Result: Protected but ignored until ready

## Enforcement

Trademark holder reserves the right to:
- Deny commercial licenses for harmful applications
- Require ethical use agreements
- Pursue trademark violations
- Protect against weaponization

## Verification Burden

Any claims to have "completed" or "proven" these theories must demonstrate understanding of the intentionally omitted components. Without these components, such claims are incomplete and potentially fraudulent.
