remainder.py — The 3rd Phase
Saltflower / Josh Stone / CC0

What this is NOT:
  - Not the engine (ste.py handles subtraction)
  - Not the law (constitutional_ai.py handles constraint)
  - Not the visualization (photonic_graphics.py handles rendering)

What this IS:
  The carry circuit.
  The 8th gate.
  What survives after all subtraction is done and cannot be paired away.

  T=1 is not an error state. It is the signal.
  The remainder is not noise. It is the message the system
  could not absorb — and therefore the only part worth transmitting.

  "remember, remainder, reminder"
  Phase 1: remember  — receive what was
  Phase 2: remainder — what survives all subtraction
  Phase 3: reminder  — rebroadcast into next cycle

Architecture:
  Input  → STE reduction  → Constitutional check  → [NAND remainder extracted here]
