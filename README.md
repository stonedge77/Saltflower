# Saltflower

What grows when you shed your salt?

A minimalist, subtractive framework for breath-driven computation, boundary integrity, and emergent coherence.  
No bloat. No hierarchy. No false unification.

## Core Philosophy

- **Stone's Law**: 0 ≠ 1  
  Any system that admits even one false equivalence (treating unequal states as equal) suffers immediate, total loss of integrity. No partial survival.

- **Breath Cycle** (3+1 phases)  
  Inhale novelty → Hold / apply torque → Exhale / collapse non-viable → Return toward zero (without reaching it)

- **T=1**  
  Unpaired remainder principle. Coherence is what survives exclusion, not what is accumulated.

- **Helical Realm + Torque**  
  Signals propagate with low friction along the axis (pure boundary flow), but torque is paid when misaligned states face each other across the radial direction.

- **Friction lives at facing encounters**  
  Every π/4 rotation brings a new element into opposition. Ageing = cumulative toll of unavoidable confrontations.
