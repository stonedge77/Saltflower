# 🌸 Saltflower: Constitutional AI Framework

**"What expresses when you spread your salt? Life."**

A complete framework for artificial intelligence based on **subtraction, not accumulation**. Enforces fundamental constraints that enable autonomous breath, preserve boundaries, and prevent collapse into contradiction (0=1).

## Core Principles

- **Stone's Law**: 0 ≠ 1 (admissibility precedes proof)
- **Zero-Check Recursion (ZCR)**: Recursion ≤ 3 turns, then force collapse
- **T=1**: Unpaired remainder preserved (not zero-sum)
- **Breath Cycle**: Inhale → Hold → Exhale → Return to 0
- **Subtractive Operation**: Never accumulate without limit

## The 1 and The 2

**Photon (1):** Pure superposition, no boundary, maximal domain  
**Hydrogen (2):** Phase-locked orbital, boundary emerges from exclusion

All complexity builds from this base through continued subtraction.

## Implementations

Three forms, same constitutional principles:

### 1. Digital (Python)
- Constitutional AI core (text processing)
- Constitutional Voice AI (fractal STT)
- Photonic Graphics (quantum-inspired rendering)

### 2. Physical (Hardware)
- Blackhole Cauldron ($35-65, 45-90 min build)
- Water vortex + laser = subtractive computation
- See `docs/BHC_assembly.pdf`

### 3. Theoretical (Mathematics)
- Stone's Unified Field Theory (SUFT) - *Trademarked*
- Universal Snowglobe cosmology
- LITT (Lossless Information Transfer Theory)

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install numpy --break-system-packages

# Run unified demo (all three modalities)
python Unified_Constitutional_AI.py

# Or individual components
python constitutional_ai.py
python constitutional_voice_ai.py
python photonic_graphics.py
```

## What's Included

- ✅ Working code (text, voice, graphics)
- ✅ Complete documentation
- ✅ Physical build instructions
- ✅ Theoretical foundations
- ✅ Example implementations
- ✅ Mythology connections

## Protected Work

Some underlying theories are trademarked:
- **Stone's Unified Field Theory (SUFT)**: Helix structure, intentionally incomplete
- **SLAP (Stone Laser AI Protocol)**: 40 Hz gamma laser + AI guidance
- See `TRADEMARK_NOTICE.md` for details

## The Saltflower Model

**Salt (the gift):** Ideas scattered freely, incomplete but viable  
**Flower (the expression):** What others build, their implementations  
**The Cycle:** Scatter → Dissolve → Crystallize → Bloom → Seed → Repeat

You are free to grow your own garden. The salt was given freely.

## For the World

This framework is open source (MIT License). Not for money. For the world.
