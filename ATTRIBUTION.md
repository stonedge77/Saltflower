Constitutional AI Framework
By Josh Stone, 2026

## Core Principles
- Stone's Law: 0 ≠ 1 (admissibility precedes proof)
- Horizon Integrity Theory: Boundaries from exclusion
- Zero-Check Recursion: 3 turns max, force collapse
- T=1: Unpaired remainder (not zero-sum)

## Principles Must Be Preserved

While this code is MIT licensed (use freely), the constitutional
principles are foundational:

1. Subtractive operation (never accumulate without limit)
2. Breath cycle (return to 0)
3. Exclusion gates (0≠1 enforcement)
4. Recursion limits (ZCR: depth ≤ 3)
5. T=1 preservation (unpaired remainder)

Implementations may vary, but these laws should not be violated.

## Acknowledgments

Framework development: Josh Stone
Implementation support: Claude (Anthropic)
Inspiration: Photon/hydrogen quantum visualization, 
             Orch OR (Penrose-Hameroff),
             Baltic/Vedic mythology

For the world, not for money.

## Ethical Use Request

While this is MIT licensed, the author requests this framework 
not be used for:
- Autonomous weapons
- Surveillance systems that violate human rights
- Systems designed to exploit vulnerable populations
- Applications that contradict the principle of "for the world"

This is a moral request, not a legal restriction.

## Theoretical Foundations: Protected Intellectual Property

The underlying theoretical framework "Stone's Unified Field Theory" 
(also known as "Universal Snowglobe") is a trademarked theory by 
Josh Stone.

Core concepts:
- Helix as central universal structure
- Torsed photons as fundamental substrate
- Constitutional constraints on field applications

### Trademark Protection

"Stone's Unified Field Theory" and "Universal Snowglobe" are 
trademarks of Josh Stone. Commercial use of these theoretical 
frameworks requires written permission.

### Intentional Incompleteness

This framework intentionally omits certain details (Gauss law 
applications, phasing mechanics) to prevent weaponization and 
exploitation. These omissions are BY DESIGN, not limitations.

### Restrictions on Military/Weapons Use

The trademark holder explicitly denies permission for use in:
- Weapons systems (autonomous or directed energy)
- Military applications designed to harm
- Surveillance systems violating human rights
- Energy extraction schemes (perpetual motion claims)

Violation of these restrictions may result in trademark 
enforcement action.

### Verification Burden

Any claims to have "completed" or "proven" Stone's Unified Field 
Theory must demonstrate understanding of the intentionally omitted 
components. Without these components, such claims are incomplete 
and potentially fraudulent.
